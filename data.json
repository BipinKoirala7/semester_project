Many smartwatches are equipped with sensors that track the user's daily activity, heart rate, and even sleep patterns. This data can be valuable for health monitoring and improving well-being, but it also raises security risks. If these data are not properly protected, they can be vulnerable to hacking, misuse, or unauthorized access. The extensive collection of personal information without sufficient privacy protections creates serious concerns about the security and confidentiality of users' data."

One of the most common issues is the disruption of sleep patterns, as users may become overly reliant on their devices for monitoring sleep quality or notifications. Constant interaction with the device, especially before bedtime, can interfere with restful sleep, leading to insomnia or poor sleep quality. Moreover, the electromagnetic fields (EMF) emitted by these devices have been linked to potential health risks such as headaches, nausea, and even anxiety for some users. Although more research is needed to fully understand the long-term health implications of prolonged exposure to EMF, these concerns are valid for individuals who are sensitive to such frequencies."

Striking a balance between innovation and user well-being is crucial to addressing these negative impacts."
